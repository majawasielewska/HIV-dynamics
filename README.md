#  HIV-dynamics

Modeling the dynamics of HIV within a host with simple sets of differential equations that implement both wild-type and drug-resistant viruses. The project shows what factors inhibit or facilitate the emergence of drug resistance.

Description of the problem:
HIV infection requires lifelong treatment in most cases. The biggest problem with long-term therapy is the emergence of drug resistance. In chronic infection, there is a huge amount of virus, which causes frequent mutations in its genetic code. The virus becomes resistant to the drug, which stops working within a few weeks, which can eventually lead to illness and even death. Understanding the emergence of drug resistance is therefore crucial in the treatment of HIV infection, which was the aim of this project.

Drug resistance:
Before starting to study the problem of drug resistance, both a drug-sensitive wild-type virus and a drug-resistant variant had to be introduced into the program. This was done by replicating the equation created for the infected cells and administering the drug to the patients. The model was implemented and therapy was started to be simulated.

The course of infection was studied by observing changes in the following three parameters over time: change in the number of infected cells, change in the number of virions, change in the number of TCD4 cells. A model was introduced that depended on 5 parameters and it was observed how the course of the disease changes when the values of these parameters change.
